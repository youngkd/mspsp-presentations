# Presentations on the MSPSP
This repository contains some of the presentations I
have done about a Constraint Programming (CP) model created
to solve the Multi-Skill Project Scheduling Problem (MSPSP).

The majority of work on the CP model was completed during a
Summer internship at CSIRO's Data61.
Andreas Schutt and Thibaut Feydy supervised this work and duly deserve
credit for their assistance.
